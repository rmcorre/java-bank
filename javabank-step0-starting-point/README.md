# java-bank
This project is a review of the original Java-Bank project students completed for the 28th bootcamp of the Academia De Codigo curriculum.

Java-bank incorporates many of the core Java programming-language concepts taught previously and introduces some of the libraries, frameworks, and tools encountered in the Java ecosystem for building modern applications better and faster.

Why a bank?
A banking system covers a lot of the functionality and responsibilities of a typical enterprise application, such as:
* User Interface
* Client/Server Architecture
* Relational Databases
* Database Transactions
